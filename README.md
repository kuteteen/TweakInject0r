# TweakInject0r

This is an Xcode project that will make installing tweaks on a non-jailbroken device easy.

***You need to have a registered Apple Developer Account and Xcode to use this permanently on your iOS device.***

***If you use this with a free Apple Developer Account, your app provisioning profile will be revoked within 7 days and you have to repeat the process.***

***iOS 10 push notifications are broken for now, a fix or a workaround will be figured out soon.***

Instructions:
- Download a cracked version of your app here https://www.iphonecake.com
- Rename the downloaded ipa to "app.ipa"
- Copy and Paste "app.ipa" into the root folder of the project (with the "TweakInject0r.xcodeproj" file)
- Open "TweakInject0r.xcodeproj"
- Change "INSERT-UNIQUE-APP-ID-HERE" to your desired Bundle Identifier
- Make sure you select your developer account under "Team"
- A provisioning profile issue will appear, click "Fix issue"
- Run the project on your iDevice and wait for it to finish.
- All Done.
